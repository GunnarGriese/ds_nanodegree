    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Binary Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression plays an important rule in many real-world applications whenever it comes to classification problems. It is frequently used to predict customer churn (http://wak2.web.rice.edu/bio/My%20Reprints/Defection%20detection.pdf) but also for solving marketing attribution problems in e-commerce (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2343077).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of logistic regression algorithm is considered to be more informative than other classification algorithms. It directly expresses the relationship between the label and each of features by deriving the coefficients. So, the researcher is not only able to understand the feature importance but also to evaluate its direction of importance (positive or negative association). This information is valuable to better understand the overall relationships hidden in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, logistic regression is limited to classification problems (binary or multi-class) since it cannot predict continuous outcome variables. Furthermore, logistic regression is prone to overfitting, because sapling bias might have a negative impact on geralizing the model to unseen data. Last but not least it needs to be used with caution when it comes to imbalanced data sets, where the label of interest is underrepresented. The algorithm tries to maximize the LogLikelihood-function and therefore will achieve \"good\" results by overvaluing the overrepresented class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the logistic regression algorithm is rather simple to understand and transparent in its output it can contribute further information to CharityML to better understand possible donators. Moreover, the provided data set is not too imbalanced. Therefore I expect to achieve good results in predicting donators."

    "### Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on decision trees and combined with aggregation and bootstrap ideas as well, Random Forest Classifiers are used in a variety of classification and regression problems. Whether it's churn analysis or predicting the likelihood of other customer decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, because the algorithm is relatively easy to implement and fast to train. It always converges and overfitting is seldomly a problem, because of the nature of the algorithm (https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf). A further advantage of random forests is that they can be used for both regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, it’s easy to view the relative importance it assigns to the input features and thereby providing the researcher with some context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, random forests provide good results when it comes to classification. Their main limitation is that a large amount of trees in the forest can make the algorithm slow and therefore ineffective for real-time applications. Another weakness is that the algorithm can be considered as a black-box (https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf). The algorithm will only tell you which features are more important to build the trees, without providing information on the direction of association (unlike the logistic regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the algorithm seems to be a great choice to solve this classification problem. I expect it to make accurate predictions on the test data set without too much training effort. On top of that, it provides an indicator of the importance it assigns to the features with further supports CharityML."

    "### AdaBoost Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost is another Ensembling Method like the random forest. In real world applications, the AdaBoost Classifier has been used for many binary classification problems. One of these applications includes face detection where the algorithm has to identify wether a portion of an image is a face or background (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the random forest algorithm the Adaboost Classifier is a fast to train algorithm and unlikely to overfitting the training data. It is iteratively trained gives more weight to missclassified observations to allow the classifier to focus on the harder cases. This procedure increases overall model's performance. (http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, data preprocessing plays an important role when using AdaBoost Classifiers, since traing data's outliers  have negative effect on the model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the training data is already preprocessed and not noisy it seems to be a good fit to the CharityML case. As well as the random forest it will quickly produce good results, also on the test data set."

    "AdaBoost Classifier is a method proposed by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1996 (http://rob.schapire.net/papers/explaining-adaboost.pdf). As all ensemble learning methods the AdaBoost algorithm uses more than one classifier to increase the overall accuracy. The final, strong classifier is build by combining multiple \"weak\" classifiers. Therefore, AdaBoost takes an iterative approach to achieve good performance with the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, the Adaboost algorithm randomly chooses a training subset (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/adaboost-classifier-python). I then trains the model again and again by selecting the \"new\" training set based on accurate prediction of the previous training iteration. In each of the steps it gives higher credit to wrongly predicted observations. In the following iteration these observations will get a high probability for classification.\n",
    "Also, it evaluates the trained classifier in each iteration according to its accuracy. The more accurate classifier will get a higher weight than the weak one. This process is repeated until a specified number of estimators is reached. Classification is then done by adding weights across all the trained classifiers.\n",

    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
